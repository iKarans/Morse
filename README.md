# Morse Code Translator

## Introduction
A Morse Code Translator desgined using HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript using a mobile-first approach.

As you enter an english letter, it will automatically translate it to morse. By clicking the arrows, you can have the same functionality but for translating from morse. There is a light bulb button to toggle light mode and a sound button to hear the morse code speech. The sound was done using a library called morseSynth by [netaction](https://github.com/netAction/morseSynth).
